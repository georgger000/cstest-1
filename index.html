    <p>Hello World! This is my first website. Yay! 
    <p>Here is another paragraph of text.
    <hr color=black>
    <p>And here is another paragraph
    Notice thatspacing doesn't really matter .
    Everything is printing on one line on the page.
    Even though in the code, these are all seprate lines.
    <p>If you want a new line, you need to use another paragraph tag
    <p>See.

<h1>My Two Images</h2>
    <i>This a black and white image I found on Google Images, </i>

    <i>but it's actaully from Pininterst so they should get the credit.</i>
<hr color=pink>

<img src= "blacknwhiteCS.jpeg" width=200.>
    <i> The image has a flock of birds, which I thought looked nice.</i>
<hr color=pink>
    <i> My second image is also black and white, to keep the <b>aesthetic.</b> (haha)</i>
<p>What lead me to choosing this photo is my liking towards white roses.
